"To answer this question, we first need to join the necessary tables and then calculate the required statistics. ```SQL -- Join the necessary tables SELECT u2base.rating, actors.a_gender, movies.movieid, directors.d_quality, directors.directorid, directors.d_quality as worst_quality FROM u2base JOIN movies2actors ON u2base.movieid = movies2actors.movieid JOIN actors ON movies2actors.actorid = actors.actorid JOIN movies ON u2base.movieid = movies.movieid JOIN movies2directors ON movies.movieid = movies2directors.movieid JOIN directors ON movies2directors.directorid = directors.directorid -- Filter the data for movie id 1684910 WHERE movies.movieid = 1684910 -- Group by gender and calculate the total and average quality GROUP BY u2base.rating, actors.a_gender ``` Then, we calculate the total male and female","movies2directors, actors, movies2actors","SELECT SUM(IIF(a_gender = 'M', 1, 0)) , SUM(IIF(a_gender = 'F', 1, 0)) , CAST(SUM(IIF(a_quality = 5, 1, 0)) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(*) , CAST(SUM(IIF(a_quality = 0, 1, 0)) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(*), ( SELECT directorid FROM movies2directors WHERE movieid = 1684910 ) , ( SELECT genre FROM movies2directors WHERE movieid = 1684910 ) FROM actors WHERE actorid IN ( SELECT actorid FROM movies2actors WHERE movieid = 1684910 )",What is the total amount male and female actors who were casted in movie ID 1684910 and what is the proportion between the highest quality actors against the worst quality of actors? Indicate your answer in percentage. List the the director as well as the genre.,movielens
